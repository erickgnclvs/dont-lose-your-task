# ðŸ˜¿ Don't lose your task

Chrome extension that helps retrieve task information on Outlier.

## What it does

Gets taskId and attemptId from task for:
- Getting back to tasks when your browser acts up
- Keeping track of assignment time

## Setup

1. Download this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Turn on Developer mode
4. Click "Load unpacked" and pick this folder
5. Pin it to your toolbar

## Using it

Just go to any Outlier tasks page (works with all URL patterns like app.outlier.ai/tasks, app.outlier.ai/en/expert/tasks, or app.outlier.ai/anything/tasks), click the extension icon, and use the buttons. It'll find the IDs automatically.

## How it works

Just shows you IDs from network requests that you could already see in your browser - but way easier.

## Privacy

Only runs on Outlier pages. Doesn't send your data anywhere.

## Cover Your Ass Disclaimer

This is just an educational tool that shows you info your browser already has.

* Doesn't mess with Outlier's systems
* Doesn't break security
* Only shows what's already in your Network tab
* Use it within Outlier's rules

I made this to save time, not to game the system. Don't blame me if you use it wrong.
