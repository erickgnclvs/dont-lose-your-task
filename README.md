ðŸ˜¿ Don't lose your task

tool to get attemptId and taskId

setup:

1. download this repo
2. go to `chrome://extensions`
3. turn on Developer mode
4. click "Load unpacked" and pick this folder
5. pin it to your toolbar


only runs on Outlier pages. doesn't send data anywhere.

I made this to save time, not to game the system. don't blame me if you use it wrong.
